# jarvis_project
This is my repository for the jarvis project i made while initially learning python programming.
It uses gtts (Google-text-to-speech).
I made the project on ubuntu 19.04, you may have to make some changes on the code according to your OS.

Prerequisites:

1. Python

2. A text editor(I used idle)

3. beautiful soup: use - 

<code>apt-get install python3-bs4 </code>

or 

<code>pip install beautifulsoup4</code>

4. Google-Text-To-Speech (gTTS): use - 

<code>pip install gTTS</code>

If this ever help you, please do write to me at vik.chauhan001@gmail.com
